Encryption intersects with many of our contemporary debates about privacy. Primarily, encryption allows for the transmission of information in such a way that, if intercepted by someone else, the data would be impossible for them to decipher. We'll discuss why this might not be always the case in a bit, but let's accept this as a basic concept at first.

Surrounding this issue then is the question of how much of a right to privacy we have. From some perspectives, our right to privacy seems like it should be an absolute and inalienable right--in the absence of breaking any law or violating any terms of our social contract, there seems to believable reason that you should be compelled to volunteer information to anyone, public or private. Yet, we willingly offer this information to the world as we interact with nearly all points of technology, and the battle for this information is at the core of these debates.

First, let's look at a concept that is in the news as of right now, thanks in part to (URL)the EARN IT Act and now the (URL)Lawful Access To Encrypted Data Act: end-to-end encryption. End-to-end encryption


However, we must be careful with how we are defining "secure." While services, like web-based e-mail, might not provide end-to-end encryption, this is because they provide other features that require reading the content in a decrypted form (allowing you to search past messages, for example). If the message was encrypted, it would be impossible to search its content as an encrypted file.



Imagine you have a secret you want to share, but you want to share it with only one person. Without much difficulty, you could develop a secret language between the two of you that would be indecipherable to someone else. At its core, this is the goal of any encrypted exchange--to pass   information along
